# glx-steps
steps 4 glx

Hacked together from a note-taking app example from Remix. The main functionality is:
- creating users
- logging in and out
- creating/viewing/deleting step entries
- leaderboard

## Development

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`

Other useful commands can be found under "scripts" in `package.json`.
